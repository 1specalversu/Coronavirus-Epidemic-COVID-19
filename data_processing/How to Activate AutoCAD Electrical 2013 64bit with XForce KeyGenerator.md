AutoCAD Electrical 2013 is not just a software for drawing electrical diagrams, but also a comprehensive solution for electrical design. It has many features that help you create, modify, and document electrical controls systems with ease and accuracy. Some of these features are:

- Electrical toolset: This is a set of specialized tools that are designed for electrical design tasks. You can access a library of 65,000+ intelligent electrical symbols, automate numbering of wires and generation of component tags, generate and update multiple customized reports, support various electrical standards, and more.
- Circuit design and reuse: This feature allows you to simplify your electrical design with Circuit Builder. You can access prepopulated data to build and annotate a sampling of motor control and power feed circuits. You can also reuse existing circuits or create custom ones with the Symbol Builder tool.
- PLC I/O drawings from spreadsheets: This feature allows you to speed up your workflow by using a single data file to generate multiple drawings. You can define a project's I/O assignments and generate PLC drawings automatically from a spreadsheet, database, or comma-delimited text file.
- SQL catalog support: This feature allows you to save time with SQL catalog database support. When you generate a Bill of Materials in Autodesk Vault, the data from your AutoCAD Electrical drawings will be automatically added to the report, including the details in the catalog database.
- Coil and contact cross-referencing: This feature allows you to simplify your projects by keeping track of parent/child contacts in real time while Circuit Builder dynamically builds the circuit, assigning each component a component tag.

With AutoCAD Electrical 2013, you can boost your productivity by up to 95%\* and create high-quality electrical designs that meet industry standards and customer requirements.
