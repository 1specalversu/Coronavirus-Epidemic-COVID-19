1. Nowcasting and Forecasting the 2019-nCoV Outbreak size in Wuhan
   - Model 1: Estimating the potential number of cases in Wuhan until Jan 23
   - Model 2: Simulating Peak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan after 23 Jan
2. Real-Time forecasting of the total confirmed cases in China

#### Key limitation within models below:
1. My models conclusions are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning models.
   - Adjustments are considered by sensitivity analysis (but not enough)
2. The model s' structures are quite simple, haven't combine enough information, so cannot get really good or robust result.
   - But for the prediction of Wuhan City only, maybe enough.
   - Will keep updating model based on the latest information.

#### Main Challenges for all predictions:
1. We have limtied understanding of this new disease
   - For example, we didnot test all  people with 2019-nCoV correctly. (unclear symptoms: whether people with 2019-nCoV who do not have symptoms can transmit an infection)
2. It is hard to get the real-time correct information. (official Chinese data is under-report 100% ), especially for Wuhan.
   - For example, we do not know how many people infected when wuhan shut down.
3. The prediction is highly sensitive to the policy
   - (for example, travel restriction,  force people stay in home, wuhan build 3 new hospital for 2019-nCoV etc. ), all of these policies influenced a lot on the time-line. **When we do prediction, our key assumption is no new policy in the future**.

## Nowcasting and Forecasting the 2019-nCoV Outbreak size in Wuhan
> On January 23, authorities in Wuhan shut down the cityâ€™s public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and the airport.
> There are 9 million people stay in Wuhan after 23 Jan. And official reported that 5 million people travel out Wuhan for Chinese Spring Festival. The effective catchment population of Wuhan international airport is around 19 million.

Consider the transmissibility and population of Wuhan changed a lot before and after Jan 23, 2020, I choice different methods to nowcasting and forecasting the potential outbreak size in Wuhan city referencing by published papers.

### Model 1: [Estimating the potential number of cases in Wuhan until Jan 23](https://github.com/YiranJing/Coronavirus-Epidemic-2019-nCov/tree/master/Model%201)ðŸ˜·
   - Author: Yiran Jing
   - **Main Conclusion (_within Wuhan City only_): There are more than 38500 cases 95% CI(30000, 48470) until Jan 23**, based on 29 Jan data.
   > Method: Considering Wuhan is the major air and train transportation hub of China, we use the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally as the sample, assuming the infected people follow a Possion distribution, then calculate the 95% confidence interval by profile likelihood method. Sensitivity analysis followed by.

### Model 2: [Simulating Peak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan after 23 Jan](https://github.com/YiranJing/Coronavirus-Epidemic-2019-nCov/blob/master/Model%202)ðŸ“ˆ
   - Author: Yiran Jing
   > Method: Deterministic SIER (susceptible-exposed-infectious- recovered) model and Sensitivity analysis

   > Reference: [Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak (Jan 31)](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930260-9)

   - **Main Conclusion (_within Wuhan City only_):** (using Chinese official data between 2019-12-08 and 2020-02-02)
      - Estimated initial transmissibility **R0** (the basic reproduction number) of 2019-nCoV: **2.9**
      - **Under the most optimistic estimate, the maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 14000 (peak, not cumulative)** (_the peak of red line of the plot below._) **And the cumulative number of cases in the whole period is around 50 thousand** (_the green line_).
      - **Truth 1**: Consider inadequate medical resources and under-reported official data, Maximum infected case (peak, not cumulative) in Wuhan might between 16000 and 25000
      - **Truth 2**: Risk of transmission is still high between 23 Jan and 04 Feb, and begin to decrease after 5 Feb.
         > Based on official news on 2 Feb, cases cannot be detected immediately, also not perfect isolation. Under this situation, Maximum infected case (peak, not cumulative) in Wuhan can more than 100 thousand or even 150 thousand. (suppose k=2)

         > Update: 3 new hospitals begin to accept patents after 5 Feb.(can accept around 6 thousand patients total). Now the risk of transmission is decrease, since more patients can be in hospitals and isolated.


      - **Consider truth 1 and 2, the maximum infected case (peak, not cumulative) in Wuhan maybe between 25 thousand and 100 thousand**.
      - **The peak will appear after 22 Feb, 2020**
      - Close City policy has significant control for 2019-nCoV, otherwise, the peak of infected cases may up to 200 thousand.


   - Key assumptions within this Model:
      - Exposed group (individuals during incubation period) is 4 times larger than Infective group (4109 confirmed cases until 02 Feb)
      - After 23 Jan, confirmed cases will be isolated immediately.(i.e. only exposed group are infectious to others)
      - Assume the death rate is 3% (official number).
      - Before 23 Jan, 1 case contacts 5 people on average. While after 23 Jan, only 1 people 1 case contacts.
      - Before 23 Jan, the population in Wuhan is 11 million. After 23 Jan, population in Wuhan is 9 million.
      - The mean of incubation period is 7 days, and the mean duration of the infection is 14 days.
      - Wuhan has adequate medical resources and the official number is correct.

Note:
- Removed: heal or death
- Death: Removed group * death_rate
- Exposed: individuals during incubation period
- Susceptible: Healthy people
- Infected: Confirmed cases

### Sensitivity Analysis
#### Case 1: Official under-report Data: Sensitivity Analysis using the conclusion of [Model 1](https://github.com/YiranJing/Coronavirus-Epidemic-2019-nCov/tree/master/Model%201)
   - Wuhan has 38500 cases until 23 Jan, and 80% of them are in incubation period.
   - Assume the death rate = cure rate = 3% (official number)
   - **Estimated Maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 22000**
#### Case 2: Sensitivity Analysis under inadequate medical resources
   - Suppose the mean duration of the infection is 20 days, rather than 14 days.
   - Estimated initial transmissibility R0 (the basic reproduction number) of 2019-nCoV: 3.7
   - **Estimated Maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 16000** under official data

#### Case 3: Sensitivity Analysis considering higher transmission probability
   > Dr.Lanjuan Li on feb 02 said that due to limited testing kits, some cases cannot be detected correctly or immediately, Also not perfect isolation
   > 2019-nCoV has lots of transmission ways, thus harder to prevent than other epidemic.

   - Suppose after 23 Jan, 2 people a case may infect
   - **Estimated Maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 100000** under official data

#### Case 4: Official under-report Data + inadequate medical resources
   - Suppose the mean duration of the infection is 20 days
   - Suppose Wuhan 38500 cases until 23 Jan, and 80% of them are in incubation period
   - **Estimated Maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 25000**

#### Case 5: Official under-report Data + inadequate medical resources + higher transmission probability
   - Suppose the mean duration of the infection is 20 days
   - Suppose Wuhan 38500 cases until 23 Jan, and 80% of them are in incubation period
   - Suppose after 23 Jan, 2 people a case may infect
   - **Estimated Maximum infected case in Wuhan: more than 150000**

## Real-Time forecasting of the total confirmed cases in China

Estimating the confirmed cases of China in the next few days based on the latest data from DingXiangYuan

#### Step:
1. Query the latest data from DingXiangYuan
```sh
## Update data from DXY
$ cd data_processing && python DXY_AreaData_query.py # save data out to data folder.
```
2. Baseline model forecasting
> Hyper-parameter selection: Using the last 3 days as the test data  

Note: blue line is the prediction for the next 4 days. (the black points are the real records form DXY)
